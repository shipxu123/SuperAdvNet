## Usage
1. First, install the required enviromental setup.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Go to the workspace dir of cifar10 and cifar100, and enjoy it:)
```
cd bignas_adv_cifar10         # or (bignas_adv_cifar100)
bash train.sh                 # train the superAdvNet, save the weight of superAdvNet
cd Adv_Evaluate               # or (Adv_Sample_Accuracy)
bash run.sh                   # get the adv result generated from the same model
cd ../Max_Adv_Evaluate        # or (Max_Adv__Sample_Accuracy)
bash run.sh                   # get the adv result generated from uncompressed model
cd ../Min_Adv_Evaluate        # or (Min_Adv_Sample_Accuracy)
bash run.sh                   # get the adv result generated from fully compressed model
```
